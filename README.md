A Node.js script expected to be run by a scheduler that checks retail website prices and sends email if any changes are detected. 

This currently has the website, price, and selector used to identify the page's price element hardcoded but eventually will be configurable. Multiple prices will also be supported, but currently the script only knows how to check for one at a time.
